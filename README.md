# data-structures-and-algos

A collection of some of my projects demonstrating work with various types of data structures and algorithms.

### birthdays
Birthdays uses a self-implemented hashtable with quadratic probing to simulate the collection of randomly surveyed birthdates until a collision is found (when two people have the same birthday).

### rsa-encryption-decryption
This RSA encryption and decryption program uses big primes (not bigger than longs in this instance) and modular exponentiation to securely and quickly encrypt and decrypt messages.

### bst
Standard implementation of both a binary search tree and avl tree.
